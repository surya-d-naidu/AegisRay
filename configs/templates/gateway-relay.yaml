# 🌐 TEMPLATE: Mesh Gateway / Relay Node
# Use this for a VPS/Server with a stable Public IP.
# Its job is to help NAT'd peers connect and relay traffic.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# Node Identity
node_name: "gateway-01"
# mesh_ip: "100.64.0.1"      # Gateways should usually have a fixed, low IP

# Network Settings
network_name: "aegis-corp"
listen_port: 51820
mtu: 1420

# Relay Capabilities
mesh_routing: true           # CRITICAL: Allow relaying packet A -> Me -> B
accept_routes: true          # Learn routes from others

# Security
use_tls: true
stealth_mode: true           # Can be disabled if your firewall allows UDP explicitly

# System
enable_tun: false            # Set false if this is PURE relay (save resources)
                             # Set true if you want to ping from this node

# Discovery
static_peers: []             # Gateways are usually the "roots", they wait for connection
